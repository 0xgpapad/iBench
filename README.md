# iBench

iBench is a suite of contentious microbenchmarks. It was originally written to evaluate Paragon (Delimitrou and Kozyrakis, ASPLOS'13, March 2013) but has since been considerably altered. 
iBench's main goal is to create a set of configurable microbenchmarks, with tunable intensity, each targeting a different shared resource. 

You can find more details about iBench in our IISWC 2013 paper: http://web.stanford.edu/~cdel/2013.iiswc.ibench.pdf
